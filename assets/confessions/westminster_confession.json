And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. [3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. [4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. [5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. [6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. [7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. [8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. [9] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. [10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. [11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. [12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. [13] And the evening and the morning were the third day. [14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: [15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. [16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. [17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, [18] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. [19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. [20] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. [21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. [22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. [23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. [24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. [25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. [26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. [27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. [28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. [29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. [30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. [31] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."

[38:3] Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. [38:4] Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. [38:5] Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? [38:6] Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; [38:7] When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? [38:8] Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? [38:9] When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, [38:10] And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, [38:11] And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? [38:12] Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; [38:13] That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? [38:14] It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. [38:15] And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. [38:16] Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? [38:17] Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? [38:18] Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. [38:19] Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, [38:20] That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? [38:21] Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? [38:22] Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, [38:23] Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? [38:24] By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? [38:25] Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; [38:26] To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; [38:27] To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? [38:28] Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? [38:29] Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? [38:30] The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. [38:31] Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? [38:32] Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? [38:33] Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? [38:34] Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? [38:35] Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are? [38:36] Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? [38:37] Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, [38:38] When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? [38:39] Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, [38:40] When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? [38:41] Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. [39:1] Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? [39:2] Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? [39:3] They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. [39:4] Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. [39:5] Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? [39:6] Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. [39:7] He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. [39:8] The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. [39:9] Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? [39:10] Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? [39:11] Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? [39:12] Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? [39:13] Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? [39:14] Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, [39:15] And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. [39:16] She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; [39:17] Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. [39:18] What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. [39:19] Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? [39:20] Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. [39:21] He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. [39:22] He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. [39:23] The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. [39:24] He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. [39:25] He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. [39:26] Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? [39:27] Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? [39:28] She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. [39:29] From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off. [39:30] Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she. [40:1] Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, [40:2] Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. [40:3] Then Job answered the LORD, and said, [40:4] Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. [40:5] Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. [40:6] Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, [40:7] Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. [40:8] Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? [40:9] Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? [40:10] Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. [40:11] Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. [40:12] Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. [40:13] Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. [40:14] Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee. [40:15] Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. [40:16] Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. [40:17] He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. [40:18] His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. [40:19] He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. [40:20] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. [40:21] He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. [40:22] The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. [40:23] Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. [40:24] He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. [41:1] Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down? [41:2] Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? [41:3] Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee? [41:4] Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? [41:5] Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? [41:6] Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? [41:7] Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? [41:8] Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. [41:9] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? [41:10] None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? [41:11] Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. [41:12] I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. [41:13] Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? [41:14] Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. [41:15] His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. [41:16] One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. [41:17] They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. [41:18] By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. [41:19] Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. [41:20] Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. [41:21] His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. [41:22] In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. [41:23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. [41:24] His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. [41:25] When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. [41:26] The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. [41:27] He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. [41:28] The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble. [41:29] Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. [41:30] Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. [41:31] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. [41:32] He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. [41:33] Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. [41:34] He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride."

[8:3] For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. [8:4] For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: [8:5] Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. [8:6] But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. [8:7] For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. [8:8] For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: [8:9] Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. [8:10] For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: [8:11] And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. [8:12] For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. [8:13] In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. [9:1] Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. [9:2] For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. [9:3] And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; [9:4] Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; [9:5] And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. [9:6] Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. [9:7] But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: [9:8] The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: [9:9] Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; [9:10] Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. [9:11] But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; [9:12] Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. [9:13] For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: [9:14] How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? [9:15] And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. [9:16] For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. [9:17] For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. [9:18] Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. [9:19] For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, [9:20] Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. [9:21] Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. [9:22] And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. [9:23] It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. [9:24] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: [9:25] Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; [9:26] For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. [9:27] And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: [9:28] So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. [10:1] For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. [10:2] For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. [10:3] But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. [10:4] For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. [10:5] Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: [10:6] In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. [10:7] Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. [10:8] Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; [10:9] Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. [10:10] By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. [10:11] And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: [10:12] But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; [10:13] From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. [10:14] For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. [10:15] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, [10:16] This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; [10:17] And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. [10:18] Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. [10:19] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, [10:20] By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; [10:21] And having an high priest over the house of God; [10:22] Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. [10:23] Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) [10:24] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: [10:25] Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. [10:26] For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, [10:27] But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. [10:28] He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: [10:29] Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? [10:30] For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. [10:31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. [10:32] But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; [10:33] Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. [10:34] For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. [10:35] Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. [10:36] For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. [10:37] For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. [10:38] Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. [10:39] But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."

[26:3] Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, [26:4] And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. [26:5] But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. [26:6] Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, [26:7] There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. [26:8] But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? [26:9] For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. [26:10] When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. [26:11] For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. [26:12] For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. [26:13] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. [26:14] Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, [26:15] And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. [26:16] And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. [26:17] Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? [26:18] And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. [26:19] And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. [26:20] Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. [26:21] And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. [26:22] And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? [26:23] And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. [26:24] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. [26:25] Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. [26:26] And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. [26:27] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; [26:28] For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. [26:29] But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. [26:30] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. [26:31] Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. [26:32] But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. [26:33] Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. [26:34] Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. [26:35] Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. [26:36] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. [26:37] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. [26:38] Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. [26:39] And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. [26:40] And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? [26:41] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. [26:42] He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. [26:43] And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. [26:44] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. [26:45] Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [26:46] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. [26:47] And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. [26:48] Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. [26:49] And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. [26:50] And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him. [26:51] And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. [26:52] Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. [26:53] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? [26:54] But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? [26:55] In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. [26:56] But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. [26:57] And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. [26:58] But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. [26:59] Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; [26:60] But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, [26:61] And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. [26:62] And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? [26:63] But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. [26:64] Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. [26:65] Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. [26:66] What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. [26:67] Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, [26:68] Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? [26:69] Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. [26:70] But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. [26:71] And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. [26:72] And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. [26:73] And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. [26:74] Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. [26:75] And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. [27:1] When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: [27:2] And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. [27:3] Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, [27:4] Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. [27:5] And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. [27:6] And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. [27:7] And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. [27:8] Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. [27:9] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; [27:10] And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me. [27:11] And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. [27:12] And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. [27:13] Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? [27:14] And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. [27:15] Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. [27:16] And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. [27:17] Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? [27:18] For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. [27:19] When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. [27:20] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. [27:21] The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. [27:22] Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. [27:23] And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. [27:24] When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. [27:25] Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. [27:26] Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. [27:27] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. [27:28] And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. [27:29] And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! [27:30] And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. [27:31] And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. [27:32] And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. [27:33] And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, [27:34] They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. [27:35] And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. [27:36] And sitting down they watched him there; [27:37] And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. [27:38] Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. [27:39] And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, [27:40] And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. [27:41] Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, [27:42] He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. [27:43] He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. [27:44] The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. [27:45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. [27:46] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [27:47] Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. [27:48] And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. [27:49] The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. [27:50] Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. [27:51] And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; [27:52] And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, [27:53] And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. [27:54] Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. [27:55] And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: [27:56] Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children. [27:57] When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: [27:58] He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. [27:59] And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, [27:60] And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. [27:61] And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. [27:62] Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, [27:63] Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. [27:64] Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. [27:65] Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. [27:66] So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."

[2] For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. [3] And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; [4] Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; [5] And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. [6] Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. [7] But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: [8] The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: [9] Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; [10] Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. [11] But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; [12] Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. [13] For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: [14] How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? [15] And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. [16] For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. [17] For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. [18] Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. [19] For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, [20] Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. [21] Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. [22] And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. [23] It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. [24] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: [25] Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; [26] For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. [27] And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: [28] So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."

[4] If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. [5] And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: [6] Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. [7] And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. [8] If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. [9] And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. [10] If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. [11] And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. [12] He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. [13] And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. [14] But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. [15] And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. [16] And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. [17] And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. [18] And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: [19] If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. [20] And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. [21] Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money. [22] If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. [23] And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, [24] Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, [25] Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. [26] And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. [27] And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. [28] If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. [29] But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. [30] If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. [31] Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. [32] If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. [33] And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; [34] The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. [35] And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.

[2] Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; [3] And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. [4] They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. [5] Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. [6] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. [7] And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. [8] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! [9] For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. [10] Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; [11] Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: [12] Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. [13] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. [14] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. [15] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! [16] For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. [17] Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. [18] Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. [19] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. [20] He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. [21] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! [22] And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. [23] They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; [24] These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. [25] For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. [26] They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. [27] They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. [28] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. [29] He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. [30] Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. [31] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! [32] Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. [33] He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; [34] A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. [35] He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. [36] And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; [37] And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. [38] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. [39] Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. [40] He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. [41] Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. [42] The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. [43] Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD."

[16] There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. [17] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?

[20] So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.

And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.

And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. [29:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. [29:3] He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. [29:4] And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, [29:5] And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. [29:6] For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. [29:7] Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. [29:8] Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. [29:9] For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. [29:10] Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. [29:11] My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. [29:12] Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: [29:13] And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: [29:14] And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. [29:15] And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. [29:16] And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron. [29:17] Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. [29:18] Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. [29:19] Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD. [29:20] Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. [29:21] And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD. [29:22] So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. [29:23] And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: [29:24] And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. [29:25] And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets. [29:26] And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. [29:27] And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel. [29:28] And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. [29:29] And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. [29:30] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. [29:31] Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. [29:32] And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. [29:33] And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. [29:34] But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. [29:35] And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order. [29:36] And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly. [30:1] And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel. [30:2] For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. [30:3] For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. [30:4] And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. [30:5] So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written. [30:6] So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. [30:7] And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. [30:8] Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. [30:9] For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. [30:10] So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. [30:11] Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. [30:12] Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. [30:13] And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. [30:14] And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. [30:15] Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. [30:16] And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites. [30:17] For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. [30:18] For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one [30:19] That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. [30:20] And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. [30:21] And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. [30:22] And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers. [30:23] And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness. [30:24] For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. [30:25] And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. [30:26] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. [30:27] Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven."

[2] And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. [3] And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. [4] And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. [5] And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. [6] And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. [7] And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. [8] And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. [9] Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. [10] And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. [11] And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. [12] And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. [13] And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. [14] And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. [15] Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. [16] And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. [17] Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. [18] And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. [19] And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. [20] And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem. [21] And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant. [22] Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; [23] But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem. [24] Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. [25] And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. [26] Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal."

[24] Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: [25] And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. [26] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: [27] (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) [28] That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.

[8:3] For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; [8:4] Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. [8:5] And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. [8:6] Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. [8:7] Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. [8:8] I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. [8:9] For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. [8:10] And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. [8:11] Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. [8:12] For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. [8:13] For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: [8:14] But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: [8:15] As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. [8:16] But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. [8:17] For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. [8:18] And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; [8:19] And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: [8:20] Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: [8:21] Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. [8:22] And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. [8:23] Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. [8:24] Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. [9:1] For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: [9:2] For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. [9:3] Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: [9:4] Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. [9:5] Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness. [9:6] But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. [9:7] Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. [9:8] And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: [9:9] (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. [9:10] Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;) [9:11] Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. [9:12] For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; [9:13] Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; [9:14] And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you. [9:15] Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."

And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. [29:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. [29:3] He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. [29:4] And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, [29:5] And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. [29:6] For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. [29:7] Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. [29:8] Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. [29:9] For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. [29:10] Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. [29:11] My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. [29:12] Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: [29:13] And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: [29:14] And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. [29:15] And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. [29:16] And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron. [29:17] Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. [29:18] Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. [29:19] Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD. [29:20] Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. [29:21] And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD. [29:22] So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. [29:23] And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: [29:24] And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. [29:25] And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets. [29:26] And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. [29:27] And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel. [29:28] And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. [29:29] And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. [29:30] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. [29:31] Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. [29:32] And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. [29:33] And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. [29:34] But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. [29:35] And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order. [29:36] And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly. [30:1] And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel. [30:2] For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. [30:3] For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. [30:4] And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. [30:5] So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written. [30:6] So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. [30:7] And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. [30:8] Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. [30:9] For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. [30:10] So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. [30:11] Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. [30:12] Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. [30:13] And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. [30:14] And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. [30:15] Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. [30:16] And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites. [30:17] For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. [30:18] For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one [30:19] That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. [30:20] And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. [30:21] And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. [30:22] And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers. [30:23] And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness. [30:24] For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. [30:25] And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. [30:26] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. [30:27] Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven."
